CS 134 Section 1 spring 2018 SJSU
Student: John Kennedy, 001462826
Program: HW2

Requirements: 1) make the 'player' tga move around the window using the keyboard. Make rate of speed constant across platforms. 
				2) Make a background for tile based game, make the game tile based. 

Extra credit: Make the player a different tga for the  direction in which it is  moving. 
Solution: Adding on to HW 1 and fixing the issues mentioned (my detection  of keys is a loop that eats up time). I have added a real 
		time timer to allow for  moving the glifs at a given rate of speed.  I rewrote program one to be more object oriented
		and easier to adapt to future plans. There are game piece objects now, and background and layer arrays that hold game pieces. 
		Also, I've switched to Warcraft pieces that I love.
