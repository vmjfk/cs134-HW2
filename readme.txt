CS 134 Section 1 sprint 2018 SJSU
Student: John Kennedy, 001462826
Program: an extremely simple game, if you look just right and squint. 

Requirements: make the 'player' tga move around the window using the keyboard. 
Extra credit: make something chase the player. 
Solution: I added code to this template to use the arrow keys to move in the indicated direction. 
I also added a tga of the NVIDIA autonomous racing vehicle as the chaser. Every time the key code is scanned and found to move the player, 
the chaser moves one position towards the player. AS far as I can tell, the chaser is impossible to evade.
